I am a second-year Ph.D. student at McMaster University and a research assistant at SwiftwareLab under the supervision of [Dr. Kazem Cheshmi](https://www.cheshmi.cc/).  
For my M.Sc., I was a student at Shahid Beheshti University.  
I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of Isfahan.  
I am interested in Parallel Programming, High Performance Computing (HPC), GPU programming (CUDA), sparse computation, algorithms.
My favorite programming language is GO. Why? It made parallel programming way easier :).  

In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym 🏋️‍♂️, swimming 🏊‍♂️, walking 🚶‍♂️, and expanding my knowledge about psychology 🧠 and startups/products 🚀.
