I am a second-year Ph.D. student at McMaster University and a research assistant at SwiftwareLab under the supervision of [Dr. Kazem Cheshmi](https://www.cheshmi.cc/).  
For my M.Sc., I was a student at Shahid Beheshti University, where I got the highest GPA in the Algorithm and Computation Theory specialization.
I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of Isfahan and ranked 1st in the class.
I am interested in Parallel Programming, High-performance computing (HPC), GPU programming (CUDA), sparse computation, and algorithms.
My favorite programming language is GO. Why? It made parallel programming way easier :). In my free time, I do backend web development mostly in GO, sometimes with Django.  

In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym 🏋️‍♂️, swimming 🏊‍♂️, walking 🚶‍♂️, and expanding my knowledge about psychology 🧠 and startups/products 🚀.
